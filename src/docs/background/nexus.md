## Overview

This document analyzes the alignment between the aims-leaf schema and the NeXus data format, identifying areas of compatibility, key differences, and opportunities for integration.

## Fundamental Differences in Scope and Purpose

### NeXus
- **Primary domain**: Neutron, X-ray, and muon scattering facilities
- **Data model**: HDF5-based hierarchical storage with strict structural conventions
- **Focus**: Raw experimental data capture at beamlines/instruments
- **Standardization**: International standard governed by NIAC (NeXus International Advisory Committee)
- **Adoption**: In use at major facilities including SOLEIL, Diamond, SINQ, SNS, ISIS, DESY

### aims-leaf
- **Primary domain**: Structural biology across multiple techniques
- **Data model**: LinkML semantic schema (generates JSON, YAML, RDF)
- **Focus**: End-to-end workflow from sample preparation to final structures
- **Standardization**: Research schema for multimodal imaging integration
- **Target**: Biological research community, particularly structural biology

## Structural Alignment

| NeXus Concept | aims-leaf Equivalent | Alignment Notes |
|---------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **NXentry** | **Dataset/Study** | Both serve as top-level containers, but aims-leaf separates Dataset (collection) from Study (investigation) |
| **NXsample** | **Sample** | ✅ Strong alignment - both capture specimen details, composition, preparation |
| **NXinstrument** | **Instrument** | ✅ Similar hierarchy with instrument-specific subclasses (CryoEMInstrument, XRayInstrument, SAXSInstrument) |
| **NXdetector** | Embedded in Instrument classes | aims-leaf integrates detector specs within instrument definitions |
| **NXdata** | **DataFile/Image** | Different approach - NeXus links to data arrays, aims-leaf tracks files/images as entities |
| **NXprocess** | **WorkflowRun** | ✅ Both capture processing workflows and parameters |
| **NXuser** | operator_id fields | aims-leaf uses simpler person references |
| **NXsource** | Part of Instrument classes | aims-leaf embeds source info in XRayInstrument.source_type |
| **NXbeam** | Instrument parameters | Beam characteristics distributed across instrument attributes |

## Technical Compatibility

### Areas of Strong Alignment

1. **SAXS/WAXS Data**
   - Both support small-angle scattering with similar parameters
   - Common fields: q-range, detector distance, sample-detector geometry
   - NeXus NXsas maps well to aims-leaf SAXSInstrument

2. **X-ray Crystallography**
   - NeXus NXmx (macromolecular crystallography) aligns with aims-leaf's approach
   - Both capture: beam energy, detector type, crystal parameters
   - Gold Standard NXmx could inform aims-leaf crystallography extensions

3. **Sample Metadata**
   - Temperature, pressure, humidity conditions
   - Buffer composition and pH
   - Sample concentration and preparation methods

4. **Processing Provenance**
   - Software name and version tracking
   - Processing parameters and computational resources
   - Workflow state and completion status

### Key Differences

1. **Storage Model**
   - NeXus: Requires HDF5 binary format for efficient large dataset storage
   - aims-leaf: Format-agnostic semantic model (LinkML generates multiple formats)

2. **Cryo-EM Support**
   - aims-leaf: Extensive cryo-EM modeling with specialized classes
   - NeXus: Emerging NXem definition, primarily materials-focused

3. **Biological Context**
   - aims-leaf: Rich biological metadata (sequences, PTMs, molecular composition)
   - NeXus: Technique-focused, minimal biological annotation

4. **Image Types**
   - aims-leaf: Explicitly models FTIR, fluorescence, optical, XRF as distinct classes
   - NeXus: Generic detector/data array approach

5. **Data Organization**
   - NeXus: Single-file hierarchical structure (HDF5)
   - aims-leaf: Distributed model with file references

## Integration Opportunities

### aims-leaf → NeXus Export

```python
# Potential mapping example
aims-leaf_study → NXentry
├── aims-leaf_sample → NXsample
├── aims-leaf_instrument → NXinstrument
│   └── detector_specs → NXdetector
├── aims-leaf_experiment_run → NXcollection
└── aims-leaf_workflow_run → NXprocess
```

Key mappings:
- Map aims-leaf's SAXSInstrument to NXsas application definition
- Convert XRayInstrument data to NXmx for crystallography
- Transform CryoEMInstrument to emerging NXem standard

### NeXus → aims-leaf Import

- Import NeXus raw data references as aims-leaf DataFile entities
- Extract instrument metadata from NeXus files to populate Instrument classes
- Parse NXdetector data to enhance aims-leaf Image metadata
- Map NXprocess chains to WorkflowRun sequences

## Complementary Strengths

### NeXus Strengths
- **Facility Integration**: Mature standard at synchrotrons and neutron sources
- **Performance**: HDF5 backend optimized for multi-GB datasets
- **Real-time Support**: Designed for streaming data during acquisition
- **Detector Details**: Comprehensive detector characterization and calibration

### aims-leaf Strengths
- **Biological Modeling**: Sequences, modifications, complexes, ligands
- **Multi-modal Integration**: Unified schema across cryo-EM, FTIR, fluorescence
- **Workflow Tracking**: End-to-end provenance from sample to publication
- **Semantic Web**: RDF/OWL generation for knowledge graphs

## Recommended Integration Strategy

### 1. Dual-Schema Approach
Use both schemas for their strengths:
- **NeXus**: Raw data acquisition and storage at facilities
- **aims-leaf**: Sample tracking, biological annotation, multi-technique integration

### 2. Linking Strategy
```yaml
# aims-leaf DataFile referencing NeXus data
DataFile:
  file_path: /data/nexus/2024/exp001.h5
  file_format: hdf5
  data_type: raw
  metadata:
    nexus_path: "/entry/instrument/detector/data"
    nexus_version: "2024.02"
```

### 3. Vocabulary Harmonization
Align common concepts:
- Sample preparation protocols
- Instrument specifications
- Quality metrics
- Processing parameters

### 4. Tool Development
Create converters for common workflows:
- `nexus2aims-leaf`: Extract metadata from NeXus files
- `aims-leaf2nexus`: Export to NeXus for facility deposition
- Validation tools ensuring compatibility

## Future Directions

### Potential Standardization Efforts

1. **Joint Working Group**: Establish collaboration between NeXus NIAC and structural biology communities
2. **Cryo-EM Extensions**: Contribute aims-leaf's cryo-EM model to enhance NXem
3. **Biological Extensions**: Propose NXbiomolecule base class for NeXus
4. **Multimodal Support**: Develop application definitions for integrated experiments

### Technical Developments

1. **HDF5 Backend for LinkML**: Enable direct HDF5 generation from aims-leaf schemas
2. **NeXus Validator for aims-leaf**: Ensure exported data meets NeXus requirements
3. **Metadata Bridges**: Automated extraction and transformation tools
4. **Federated Queries**: Query across aims-leaf and NeXus datasets

## Conclusion

aims-leaf and NeXus are **complementary rather than competing** standards. NeXus excels at facility-level data capture with its mature HDF5-based infrastructure, while aims-leaf provides the biological context and multi-technique integration essential for modern structural biology. 

The optimal approach involves:
- Using NeXus at data acquisition (beamlines, microscopes)
- Employing aims-leaf for biological annotation and workflow management
- Building bridges between the formats for seamless data flow
- Contributing domain expertise bidirectionally between communities

This alignment analysis suggests that both schemas can coexist and reinforce each other in the structural biology data ecosystem, with clear paths for integration and mutual enhancement.
